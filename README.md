# Single-Page Web Application Exercise

## Overview

This project showcases the functionality of a single-page web application using pure HTML and Javascript, where content from different html pages is dynamically loaded into a centralized pages when requested.  Routing principles are used as asynchronous programming fetches desired HTML content to load.  The routing also handles internal web page links that automatically scroll to pre-determined points.

## How To Run

1.  Once the landing page loads (index.html), Use the Navbar to selected a desired page.  The Javascript router will grab the desired content from the selected page and dynamically load it onto the landing page without a reload.
2.  Throughout navigation, the corresponding link in the Navbar will be highlighted to designate which page is currently showing.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Refactor application using React components
